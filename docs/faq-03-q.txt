In the previous email in the PDF I've showed:

class WW2 extends W<J2> {
  public void add(J2 t) {}
}


then you can do
   W<J2> ww2 = new WW2();
vs.
  W<J2> w2 = new W2<J2>();

IMHO, this makes a better API, since you don't give a user a wrong
assumption that you can put ANY Work class during the instantiation of
the Worker.
